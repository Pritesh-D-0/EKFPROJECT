# EKFPROJECT
SC649 Course Project\
 The goal of this project is to implement an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimating
 the pose of a robot in a 2D plane. The robot starts at the pose (0, 0, 0), with three known
 landmarks placed at specific coordinates. The EKF will be used to estimate the robotâ€™s
 pose based on trilateration data, and the robot will track a trajectory.

## Trajectory
Trajectory is Lissajous curve\
x(t) = Asin(at+delta)\
y(t) = Bsin(bt)\
A = B = 1.0 Amplitudes\
a = 1, b = 2 Frequencies\

## Updated scripts:
- controller3.py\
Implements a EKF for pose estimation and simple proportional control for trajectory following.
- vis2.py\
Image is saved iteratively to avoid backend runtime issues for live visualisation. Can view live from VS code.
